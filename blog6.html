              <p>
                Conventional drone technology has already changed the traditional understanding of the conduct of war. The remote control of drones makes deployment possible without direct personal risk from a distant control centre, on a computer screen. The development of autonomous system has been regarded as revolutionary and as a veritable paradigm shift in military technology. Currently, there are no genuinely autonomous weapons systems. Robot engineers even doubt whether such systems could ever be developed. Most technical experts however assume that it is only a matter of time before such systems are operational. The US Department of Defense has drawn up an official plan to develop and bring into service autonomous systems up to 2038. At the same time, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the speech before the United Nations, rightly pointed out that even today more and more critical functions in weapons systems operate autonomously, that is, without human intervention.<br><br>

At present, there is no universally acceptable definition of autonomous weapons systems. In the scientific literature and official government documents there are different approaches towards the definition of autonomous weapons systems. Common to all these approaches is the level of capability with regard to decision-making by means of algorithms. However, to conclude from this that no really autonomous system can exist because at a certain point a human being is always involved in the decision-making matrix, is an unjustified simplification of the problem arising. Robotic weapons which are unmanned are often divided into three categories based on the degree of human involvement in their actions:<br><br>

Human-in-the-Loop Weapons: Robots that can select targets and deliver force only with a human command;
Human-on-the-Loop Weapons: Robots that can select targets and deliver force under the oversight of a human operator who can override the robots' actions, and<br>
Human-out-of-the-Loop Weapons: Robots that are capable of selecting targets and delivering force without any human input or interaction. Autonomous Weapons Systems refer to both out of-the-Loop Weapons and those that allow a human on the Loop, but that are effectively out-of-the-Loop Weapons because the supervision is so limited.<br><br>

Many countries employ weapons defense systems that are programmed to respond automatically to threats from incoming munitions. Other precursors to fully autonomous weapons, either deployed or in development, have anti-personnel functions and are in some cases designed to be mobile and offensive weapons. Militaries value these weapons because they require less manpower, reduce the risks to their own soldiers, and can expedite response time. A number of states especially the United State, United Kingdom, Israel and others are coming close to producing the technology to make complete autonomy of Robots a reality and have a strong interest in achieving this goal. As indicated earlier, autonomous weapons systems raise serious moral and legal concerns because they would posses the ability to select and engage their targets with meaningful human control. Many people question whether to decision to kill a human being should be left to a machine. There are also grave doubts that fully autonomous weapons would ever be able to replicate human judgment and comply with the legal requirements to distinguish civilian from military targets. Other potential threats include the prospect of an arms race and proliferation to armed forces with little regard for the law. <br><br>

These concerns are compounded by the obstacles to accountability that would exist for unlawful harm caused by fully autonomous weapons. This article also doubts the possibility of holding anyone responsible for the actions of this type of weapon. It advances the view that autonomous weapons systems cannot substitute for responsible humans as defendants in any legal proceedings that seek to achieve deterrence and retribution. Furthermore, a variety of legal obstacle make it likely that humans associated with the use or production of these weapons - notably operators and commanders, programmers and manufacturers - would escape liability for the suffering caused by fully autonomous weapons. Neither criminal law nor civil law guarantees adequate accountability for individuals directly or indirectly involved in the use of fully autonomous weapons. United Nations Special Rapporteur Christof Heyns describes autonomous weapons systems as robots that gather information about their surroundings by means of sensors, which is then processed so that a decision can be taken, which is finally executed by the installed components (for example, weapons or means of transport). In accordance with the definition of the US Department of Defense Weapons Systems are autonomous if, after their activation, they independently-that is without further human intervention- select targets and attack. There is also autonomy when human decision-makers are still able to abort specific decisions to attack even after activation. The Department of Defense defined an autonomous weapon system as:<br><br>
<i style="text-align: center;"> A weapon system that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further intervention in a human operator. This include human-supervised autonomous weapon systems that are designed to allow human operators to override operation of the weapon system but can select and engage targets without further human input after activation.</i><br><br>

So, the crux of full autonomy is a capability to identify, target and attack a person or object without human interface. Although a human operator may retain the ability to take control of the system, it can operate without any control being exercised.<br><br>

<b>DETERMINATION OF LAWFULNESS OF A WEAPON SYSTEM</b><br>
It is incontrovertible that the law of armed conflict applies to autonomous weapons systems. When determining the overall lawfulness of a weapon system, there are two distinct aspects of the law that need to be analyzed:<br>
Weapons Law<br>
Targeting Law<br>
The former verifies that the weapon itself is lawful. The latter determines whether the use of the weapon system during hostilities might be prohibited in some manner under the law of armed conflict. A weapon must satisfy both aspects before it may be lawfully used on a battlefield.<br><br>

When analyzing whether the weapon system itself is lawful, there are two distinct rules that apply. The first rule is that the weapon system must not be indiscriminate by its very nature. A weapon is deemed indiscriminate by nature if it cannot be aimed at a specific target as combatants. This rule is considered to be reflective of customary international law. Accordingly all states even those not party to the Protocol (such as the United States) are bound to comply with this customary law rule against indiscriminate attack. The mere fact that an autonomous weapons systems rather than a human might be making the final targeting decision would not render the weapon indiscriminate by nature. Instead, as long as it is possible to supply the autonomous system with sufficiently reliable and accurate data to ensure it can be aimed at a military objective, then the system would not be deemed indiscriminate by nature. However, this possibility is highly remote as it is difficult to attain.
