                Urban warfare is combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities. Urban combat is very different from combat in the open at both the operational and tactical levels. Complicating factors in the urban warfare include the presence of civilians and the complexity of the urban terrain. Urban combat operations may be conducted in order to capitalize on the strategic or tactical advantages with which possession or control of a particular urban areas gives or to deny these advantages to the enemy. Fighting in urban areas negates the advantages that one side may have over the other in armour, heavy artillery, or air support. Ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld anti - tank weapons can effectively destroy entire columns of modern armour, while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the 'superior' party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible, but the defending party does not as it uses civilians as human shields. Some civilians may be difficult to distinguish from combatants such as armed militias and gangs, and particularly individuals who are simply trying to protest their homes from attackers. Tactics are complicated by a three-dimensional environment, limited fields of view and fire because of buildings, enhanced concealment and cover for defenders, below-ground infrastructure, and the ease of placement of body traps and snipers.<br><br>

Until the 20th Century, the standard model of war on land involved two main types of military operations: a confrontation on a battlefield in open country, or a siege of a city or fortress. The cities involved protected by fortifications that were manned by troops when attacked, requiring the attacker to mobilize a greater force and commit to an operation that often proved long and costly if the city had sufficient provisions. Once the besieging force broke through the ramparts, the whole city fell into its hands. This happened to Rome and Constantinople on several occasions. Jerusalem was besieged forty times and completely destroyed on two occasions. Despite the perception that more civilians were spared in the past wars than in modern wars, the fate of a city's population during these sieges was inextricably linked with that of its defendants. Up to the time of the Napoleonic wars, a victorious military commander would allow or even encourage his troops to pillage the city. The population was then subjected to all kinds of violence, and sometimes enslaved or completely massacred.<br><br>

The contemporary urban warfare was rare until the twentieth century, only really coming to prominence during the Spanish Civil War and the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s. From Barcelona to Fallujah, through Hue, Allepo, Gronzy, Maiduguri in Nigeria, the tactics involved in street battles have hardly changed. A city's outer walls are no match for modern artillery and getting through them is no longer a problem, so it is the urban fabric itself that becomes the battleground. Buildings become bunkers, sewers become communication routes, and fighting takes place at very short range in a three-dimensional space, between buildings, between floors and rooms.<br><br>

The indiscriminate bombing of cities was not only a violation of international humanitarian law (IHL) but was ineffective as a way of overcoming an opponent's resistance. This is correct because the Blitz - the Luftwaffe's bombing of London in the Second World War-failed to bring Britain to its knees. Similarly, Germany's industrial capacity grew constantly during that war, despite ever more intensive air raids. Bombing cities is even counterproductive in some cases. It can strengthen peoples desire to take revenge and can divert military resources towards targets that are of no military interest.<br><br>

Recent urban warfare have given rise to series of serious violations of humanitarian law: they include chemical weapons, destruction of cultural property, sexual violence, indiscriminate shelling deliberate targeting of civilian and medical infrastructure and terror attacks. Indiscriminate or indirect attacks on civilians captured fighters or fighters hors de combat are prohibited in all circumstances, in cities or anywhere else. In addition, given events in recent times, the law forbids the use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare, and attacks against people, vehicles or buildings involved in medical and humanitarian activities are prohibited. Fighting in a densely populated area poses a number of difficulties for the application of humanitarian law, and particularly of rules governing the methods and means of warfare.<br><br>


<b>THE DYNAMICS OF URBAN WARFARE</b><br>

Cities have a crucial place in the development path of fragile and conflict-affected states. Metropolitan areas, with their concentration of industrial and service sectors, are important engines for economic growth and productivity in developing countries. However, as urban population growth accelerates in many developing regions, the emerging consensus is that armed violence and conflict tend to increasingly affect these population centers, therefore jeopardizing broader national recovery and development. <br><br>

The unprecedented pace of global population growth in cities has triggered fears of a potential increase in the frequency of such clashes in densely inhabited areas. This is linked, according to different sources, to increased demographic pressures on urban systems, combined with the attractiveness of such spaces for non-state armed groups. The two risk factors-rapid population growth and armed activity by non-state actors-are key conclusion from strategic studies of urban conflicts. While other factors, such as informational connectivity and state weakness, also play a role, the source of expanding scholarly and humanitarian concerns about urban conflict stems from these two dynamics. For instance, the concept of 'hybrid war' was widely discussed during the conflict in eastern Ukraine starting in 2014, consisting of a combination of tactics used simultaneously 'by both states and a variety of non-state actors, primarily in cities. One influential voice from the strategic/military studies field, David Kilcullen, has pointed out that 'non state conflicts (guerrilla, tribal and civil wars, or armed criminal activity such as banditry and gang warfare)…tend to happen near or within the areas where people live' - that is, wars are taking place in 'increasingly crowded, urban, coastal' areas. <br><br>

This linkage between urbanization and non-state armed activity is further strengthened by some of the 'conflict economies' that have become associated with globalization. In defining 'deviant globalization, the US National Defence University has highlighted the geographical (particularly urban) aspects of rogue non-state dynamics: criminal flows, it asserts, go through cities in a de facto archipelago that runs from inner metropolitan cities of the United States of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro to the banlieues of Paris to the almost continuous urban slum belt that girds the Gulf of Guinea from Abijan to Lagos. A similar dynamic underlines the illicit profits driving the shift from inter-state to intra-state war according to Paul Collier's classic 'greed' theory of civil war. Subsequent studies have shown that urban lawlessness can nurture similar conflict economies: writing on the effects of neighbouring conflicts in Kabul (Afghanistan) and Karachi (Pakistan), Daniel Esser concludes that 'the classic' rural warlord seems to morph gradually into a modern urban one. With more to gain in cities with their illicit economies, non - state armed groups have been urbanizing alongside the broader populations of developing courtiers. With more to gain in cities with their illicit economies, non-state armed groups have been urbanizing alongside the broader populations of developing countries.
